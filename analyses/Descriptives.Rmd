Compile some information about the sample/data that we're working with.

```{r}
load(file.path("..", "data", "cogpsych_data_anon.Rdata"))

# Helper functions
percent <- function(X, digits=1) {
  # convert a proportion to percent and return as string with % sign.
  return( paste0(format(round(X*100, digits), nsmall=digits), "%") )
}

prettify <- function(X) {
  # Just to save myself some typing:
  return( prettyNum(X, big.mark = ",") )
}
```


# Students that gave informed consent

A total of `r nrow(grades)` students took the exam (first attempt) and of those, `r length(unique(data$User))` have used the system at least once (`r percent(length(unique(data$User)) / nrow(grades))`). There are a total of `r prettify(nrow(data))` recorded trials generated by the users that gave informed consent. 

# All recorded data

>How many students used the system?
